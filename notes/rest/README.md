# RestServer 

The team chose to use the SpringBoot-framework to establish the REST server.

### Structure 

The Notes RestServer consists of the following classes:

1. [NotesService.java](src/main/java/rest/NotesService.java): Service class, responsible for managing user accounts, notes, and various operations.
2. [NotesController.java](src/main/java/rest/NotesController.java): REST controller class, handles HTTP requests and defines API endpoints. 
3. [RestServerApplication.java](src/main/java/rest/RestServerApplication.java): Contains the start method for the server application and configures CORS.
