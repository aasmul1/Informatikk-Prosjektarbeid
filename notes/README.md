# Notes 

## Project description

Our app is an intuitive note-taking application. Users must log in with username and password, or create a user to use the app. When logged in, the user have access to their saved notes. Users can create, edit and delete notes. All notes are presented in a list, where title, text and creation date is displayed for each note. Users can choose to sort their notes based on 'Created date', 'Last edited date', or alphabetically by 'Title (A-Z)'.
